# Description  
A README is a text file that introduces and explains a project. It contains information that is commonly required to understand what the project is about. This Node JS run programm will help you to generate such files.
# Installation 
Need to have installed package.json, fs, request, axios, prompts, node modules, package-lock.json. Also its very important to have your email open to public if you want to have email info shown in a ReadME. And only because of emails i had to add a simple authentification form that requires a password for a GitHub account. 
# Usage  
Anyone who is working on a programming project, especially if you want others to use it or contribute. It's an easy way to answer questions that your audience will likely have regarding how to install and use your project and also how to collaborate with you. 
# Video
I have a recording of an example of usage the app. Check it out here: https://vimeo.com/user109190464/review/394855046/6e08399359
